      <div class="ceo-story">I started this journey in a small 3x3 meter stall, with nothing but a secondhand coffee machine and an unwavering passion. Every morning, I woke up early not just to brew coffee, but to brew hope—that each cup I served could be the reason someone smiles. From the first aroma to the last sip, MR.COFFEE was born out of love for the process, simplicity, and human connection. Now, I want to bring that warmth to the digital world, so everyone can experience the story behind each cup—no matter where they are.</div>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Company Story</h2>
    <p>In the heart of a bustling city, MR.COFFEE began as a small, classic coffee shop with quirky charm and the aroma of freshly brewed wonders. Our shop, with mismatched chairs and walls covered in customer doodles, became a cozy haven for dreamers, creatives, and anyone in need of inspiration. It wasn't just about coffee, it was about connection, laughter, and the warm smiles that filled the air. Today, we bring that same spirit to the digital world, inviting everyone to share in the magic of MR.COFFEE.</p>
